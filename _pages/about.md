I am a Physics PhD student at Yale University with a strong interest in condensed matter physics. My research focuses on the synthesis and characterization of novel quantum materials, particularly 2D systems, using advanced local probe techniques like scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

My undergraduate research at UC Berkeley in [Prof. Michael F. Crommie's group](https://crommie.berkeley.edu/) involved fabricating and studying novel 2D material systems. I gained hands-on experience with graphene break-junction device fabrication, from exfoliating and transferring 2D materials to using AFM nano-lithography. I also synthesized 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) via chemical vapor epitaxy and characterized their unique Honeycomb-Kagome electronic structure using STM and STS.

Prior to that, I worked with [Prof. Gang Li](https://spst.shanghaitech.edu.cn/2021/0304/c225a58793/page.htm) at ShanghaiTech University, where I explored the theoretical side of condensed matter, calculating long-range entanglement entropy to characterize quantum spin liquid (QSL) states.
