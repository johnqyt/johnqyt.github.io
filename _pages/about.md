I am a Physics PhD student at Yale University (starting 2025) in the [Prof. Konrad Lehnert Group](https://physics.yale.edu/people/konrad-lehnert) , where I study Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) physics and phase transitions in 1D Josephson junction chains. My research combines theory and experiment to probe topological transitions in superconducting devices.

My undergraduate research intern at UC Berkeley in [Prof. Michael F. Crommie's group](https://crommie.berkeley.edu/) involved fabricating and studying novel 2D material systems. I gained hands-on experience with graphene break-junction device fabrication. I also synthesized 2D metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) via chemical vapor epitaxy and characterized their unique Honeycomb-Kagome electronic structure using STM and STS.

Prior to that, I worked with [Prof. Gang Li](https://spst.shanghaitech.edu.cn/spst_en/2018/0301/c2939a51336/page.htm) at ShanghaiTech University, where I explored the theoretical side of condensed matter and many body physics, calculating strongly correlated states, CDW and superconductivity in the Kagome lattice system.
