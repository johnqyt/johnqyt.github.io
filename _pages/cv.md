## Research Experience
**Correlated Electronic States and Superconductivity in Kagome Lattices**, ShanghaiTech University — *Jan 2025 – Jun 2025*  
Mentor: Prof. Gang Li  
– Constructed a six-orbital tight-binding model for AV₃Sb₅ kagome metals
– Implemented multi-orbital FLEX calculations accelerated with intermediate-representation (IR) basis to map spin/charge fluctuations  
– Identified competing superconducting instabilities, suggesting possible time-reversal symmetry breaking

**Graphene Break-Junction Device Fabrication**, UC Berkeley — *Jan 2024 – Dec 2024*  
Mentor: Prof. Michael F. Crommie  
– Exfoliated monolayer graphene onto hBN via dry transfer  
– AFM-etched channels for break-junctions; shadow-mask Au electrodes  
– Programmed PPMS electrical-burning to induce break-junctions  

**Synthesis and Characterization of 2D Metal–Organic Framework**, UC Berkeley — *Jan 2024 – Dec 2024*  
Mentor: Prof. Michael F. Crommie  
– Conducted chemical vapor epitaxy of 2D MOF using NiBr₂ and HATP on Au(111), HOPG, and WSe₂  
– Fabricated graphene and WSe₂ devices using hBN sliding techniques  
– Characterized Honeycomb-Kagome electronic structure of 2D MOF with STM and STS  

**Drop Explosion of Water–Alcohol Mixture on Hydrophobic Surfaces**, ShanghaiTech University — *Sep 2021 – Oct 2022*  
Mentor: Prof. Runze Li, Prof. Yifan Jiang
– Investigated the fragmentation process of droplets upon contact with hydrophobic surfaces, studying parameters affecting droplet size distribution  
– Analyzed the explosion process using the Marangoni effect and Rayleigh–Taylor instability to deduce the physical principles underlying the phenomena
